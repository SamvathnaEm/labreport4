*Keys pressed:* ```Ctrl-C```, ```Ctrl-V``` and ```<enter>```.

Copy the ```ssh cs15lfa23fu@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` phrase I saved on my note in Google Docs by pressing ```Ctrl-C``` after highlighting that phrase, and then I pasted it on the terminal by pressing ```Ctrl-V``` and ```<enter>```. 

# Step 5: Clone my fork of the repository from my Github account (using the SSH URL)

*Keys pressed:* ```Ctrl-C```, type ```"git clone"```, ```Ctrl-V```, and ```<enter>```.

Copy the ssh URL ```git@github.com:SamvathnaEm/lab7-report-.git``` of the **lab7-report-** repository from my Github account by pressing ```Ctrl-C``` after highlighting that URL and clone that repository into ieng6 by typing ```"git clone"``` on the terminal, and pressing ```Ctrl-V```, and ```<enter>```.
# Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

*Keys pressed:* Type ```"cd lab7-report-"``` and ```<enter>```.
                Then type ```"bash te"```, ```<tab>``` and ```<enter>```.

First, we have to change the working directory to ```/lab7-report-``` directory, and then run the bash scripts in ```test.sh``` to run the junit tests. I pressed ```<tab>``` after finishing typing ```"bash te"``` to speed up the process by overwriting the existing filename inside the  ```/lab7-report-``` directory.

# Step 7: Edit the code file to fix the failing test
